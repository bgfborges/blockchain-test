## Tecnologies

- NextJS: this technology was choosen to use with this project to permit the server side generation - as long as a project in this kind of purpose won't work only with with front-end, Next permit, with its intermediate layer, to communicate with backend in a much more secury way. Also, with a brief preview of functional requirements, it's also seen that some time it will be useful to run some node functions in the server side to handle the documents etc.

- Tailwindcss: this technology was choosen because the deadline for this project is short and this package improve the experience of writing a good project style, and wasn't seen any trouble with customization as long as the functional interface requirement are very simple - making this choise very easy to be taken.
